# **DeEx3 DAO**
``Experiment`` ``Explore`` ``Examine``
## Introduction
The current system of publishing research papers is a complex and competitive process that involves various steps and actors.
- The cost of publications is increasing by 10% every year.
- Creation of monopolies.
- The research review is currently disincentive.
## Our Proposal
A decentralized platform that facilitates scientists and researchers in publishing their papers, securing grants and funding from investors, and offers a dedicated space for peer-reviewed research. Completely removing the centralized elements from the scene, our platform will be a budding place for Research and Scientific findings.

## Our Features
- Allows the viewers with knowledge in a topic , be granted a position to Approve and Dispute a research, Provided they stake a certain amount of ETH to guarentee authenticity.
- Once a paper is published, any users can approve and dispute it
  - The voting goes to a Group chat for discussion about the papers
  - After the discussion, a final round of voting takes place
- If the majority disputes the paper, it will be discarded and a percentage of the Researcher stake will be cut.
- That stake amount is used to buy Carbon Credits from Celo.
